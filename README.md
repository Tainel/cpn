# **Competitive Programming Notebook**

The project consists of useful **C++** code for competitive programming.

The root directory **cpn/** is composed of the following:

 * **source/**: contains the source code.
 * **Makefile**: set of instructions for compilation.
 * **README.md**: general information about the project.

The project is intended for **Windows** and **GNU/Linux**. Besides, the
building tool **make** is required if one wants to build the executable to
check if it compiles. The available targets for it are:

 * **build**: build the executable, default target.
 * **clean**: delete the executable.

If the code is compiled in multiple OSs, **clean** only deletes the executable
corresponding to the current OS.
